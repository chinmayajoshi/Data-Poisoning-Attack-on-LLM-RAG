No Electronic symbol", "A memristor (/\u02c8m\u025bmr\u026ast\u0259r/; a portmanteau of memory resistor) is a non-linear two-terminal electrical component relating electric charge and magnetic flux linkage. It was described and named in 1971 by Leon Chua, completing a theoretical quartet of fundamental electrical components which also comprises the resistor, capacitor and inductor.[1]\n\nChua and Kang later generalized the concept to memristive systems.[2] Such a system comprises a circuit, of multiple conventional components, which mimics key properties of the ideal memristor component and is also commonly referred to as a memristor. Several such memristor system technologies have been developed, notably ReRAM.\n\nThe identification of memristive properties in electronic devices has attracted controversy. Experimentally, the ideal memristor has yet to be demonstrated.[3][4]\n\nAs a fundamental electrical component\n\n[edit]", "As a fundamental electrical component\n\n[edit]\n\nChua in his 1971 paper identified a theoretical symmetry between the non-linear resistor (voltage vs. current), non-linear capacitor (voltage vs. charge), and non-linear inductor (magnetic flux linkage vs. current). From this symmetry he inferred the characteristics of a fourth fundamental non-linear circuit element, linking magnetic flux and charge, which he called the memristor. In contrast to a linear (or non-linear) resistor, the memristor has a dynamic relationship between current and voltage, including a memory of past voltages or currents. Other scientists had proposed dynamic memory resistors such as the memistor of Bernard Widrow, but Chua introduced a mathematical generality.\n\nDerivation and characteristics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe memristor was originally defined in terms of a non-linear functional relationship between magnetic flux linkage \u03a6m(t) and the amount of electric charge that has flowed, q(t):[1]", "{\\displaystyle f(\\mathrm {\\Phi } _{\\mathrm {m} }(t),q(t))=0}\n\nThe magnetic flux linkage, \u03a6m, is generalized from the circuit characteristic of an inductor. It does not represent a magnetic field here. Its physical meaning is discussed below. The symbol \u03a6m may be regarded as the integral of voltage over time.[5]\n\nIn the relationship between \u03a6m and q, the derivative of one with respect to the other depends on the value of one or the other, and so each memristor is characterized by its memristance function describing the charge-dependent rate of change of flux with charge:\n\n{\\displaystyle M(q)={\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\Phi _{\\rm {m}}}{\\mathrm {d} q}}\\,.}\n\nSubstituting the flux as the time integral of the voltage, and charge as the time integral of current, the more convenient forms are:\n\n{\\displaystyle M(q(t))={\\cfrac {\\mathrm {d} \\Phi _{\\rm {}}/\\mathrm {d} t}{\\mathrm {d} q/\\mathrm {d} t}}={\\frac {V(t)}{I(t)}}\\,.}", "To relate the memristor to the resistor, capacitor, and inductor, it is helpful to isolate the term M(q), which characterizes the device, and write it as a differential equation.\n\nDevice Symbol Characteristic property Units Unit ratio (V, A, C, Wb) Differential equation Resistor R Resistance ohm ( \u03a9 ) volts per ampere ( V\u2009/\u2009A ) R = d V / d I Capacitor C Capacitance farad ( F ) coulombs per volt ( C\u2009/\u2009V ) C = d q / d V Inductor L Inductance henry ( H ) webers per ampere ( Wb\u2009/\u2009A ) L = d\u03a6 m / d I Memristor M Memristance ohm ( \u03a9 ) webers per coulomb ( Wb\u2009/\u2009C ) M = d\u03a6 m / d q\n\nThe above table covers all meaningful ratios of differentials of I, q, \u03a6m, and V. No device can relate dI to dq, or d\u03a6m to dV, because I is the time derivative of q and \u03a6m is the integral of V with respect to time.", "It can be inferred from this that memristance is charge-dependent resistance. If M(q(t)) is a constant, then we obtain Ohm's law, R(t) = V(t)/I(t). If M(q(t)) is nontrivial, however, the equation is not equivalent because q(t) and M(q(t)) can vary with time. Solving for voltage as a function of time produces\n\n{\\displaystyle V(t)=\\ M(q(t))I(t)\\,.}\n\nThis equation reveals that memristance defines a linear relationship between current and voltage, as long as M does not vary with charge. Nonzero current implies time varying charge. Alternating current, however, may reveal the linear dependence in circuit operation by inducing a measurable voltage without net charge movement\u2014as long as the maximum change in q does not cause much change in M.\n\nFurthermore, the memristor is static if no current is applied. If I(t) = 0, we find V(t) = 0 and M(t) is constant. This is the essence of the memory effect.\n\nAnalogously, we can define a W(\u03d5(t)) as memductance:[1]\n\n{\\displaystyle i(t)=W(\\phi (t))v(t)\\,.}", "Analogously, we can define a W(\u03d5(t)) as memductance:[1]\n\n{\\displaystyle i(t)=W(\\phi (t))v(t)\\,.}\n\nThe power consumption characteristic recalls that of a resistor, I2R:\n\n{\\displaystyle P(t)=\\ I(t)V(t)=\\ I^{2}(t)M(q(t))\\,.}\n\nAs long as M(q(t)) varies little, such as under alternating current, the memristor will appear as a constant resistor. If M(q(t)) increases rapidly, however, current and power consumption will quickly stop.\n\nM(q) is physically restricted to be positive for all values of q (assuming the device is passive and does not become superconductive at some q). A negative value would mean that it would perpetually supply energy when operated with alternating current.\n\nModelling and validation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to understand the nature of memristor function, some knowledge of fundamental circuit theoretic concepts is useful, starting with the concept of device modeling.[6]", "Engineers and scientists seldom analyze a physical system in its original form. Instead, they construct a model which approximates the behaviour of the system. By analyzing the behaviour of the model, they hope to predict the behaviour of the actual system. The primary reason for constructing models is that physical systems are usually too complex to be amenable to a practical analysis.\n\nIn the 20th century, work was done on devices where researchers did not recognize the memristive characteristics. This has raised the suggestion that such devices should be recognised as memristors.[6] Pershin and Di Ventra[3] have proposed a test that can help to resolve some of the long-standing controversies about whether an ideal memristor does actually exist or is a purely mathematical concept.\n\nThe rest of this article primarily addresses memristors as related to ReRAM devices, since the majority of work since 2008 has been concentrated in this area.\n\nSuperconducting memristor component\n\n[edit]", "Superconducting memristor component\n\n[edit]\n\nDr. Paul Penfield, in a 1974 MIT technical report[7] mentions the memristor in connection with Josephson junctions. This was an early use of the word \"memristor\" in the context of a circuit device.\n\nOne of the terms in the current through a Josephson junction is of the form:\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}i_{M}(v)&=\\epsilon \\cos(\\phi _{0})v\\\\&=W(\\phi _{0})v\\end{aligned}}}\n\nwhere \u03f5 is a constant based on the physical superconducting materials, v is the voltage across the junction and iM is the current through the junction.\n\nThrough the late 20th century, research regarding this phase-dependent conductance in Josephson junctions was carried out.[8][9][10][11] A more comprehensive approach to extracting this phase-dependent conductance appeared with Peotta and Di Ventra's seminal paper in 2014.[12]\n\nMemristor circuits\n\n[edit]", "Memristor circuits\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to the practical difficulty of studying the ideal memristor, we will discuss other electrical devices which can be modelled using memristors. For a mathematical description of a memristive device (systems), see \u00a7 Theory.\n\nA discharge tube can be modelled as a memristive device, with resistance being a function of the number of conduction electrons ne.[2]\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}v_{\\mathrm {M} }&=R(n_{\\mathrm {e} })i_{\\mathrm {M} }\\\\{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} n_{\\mathrm {e} }}{\\mathrm {d} t}}&=\\beta n+\\alpha R(n_{\\mathrm {e} })i_{\\mathrm {M} }^{2}\\end{aligned}}}\n\nvM is the voltage across the discharge tube, iM is the current flowing through it, andne is the number of conduction electrons. A simple memristance function is R(ne) = F/ne. The parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, and F depend on the dimensions of the tube and the gas fillings. An experimental identification of memristive behaviour is the \"pinched hysteresis loop\" in the v-i plane.[a][13][14]", "Thermistors can be modeled as memristive devices:[14]\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}v&=R_{0}(T_{0})\\exp \\left[\\beta \\left({\\frac {1}{T}}-{\\frac {1}{T_{0}}}\\right)\\right]i\\\\&\\equiv R(T)i\\\\{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} T}{\\mathrm {d} t}}&={\\frac {1}{C}}\\left[-\\delta \\cdot (T-T_{0})+R(T)i^{2}\\right]\\end{aligned}}}\n\n\u03b2 is a material constant, T is the absolute body temperature of the thermistor, T0 is the ambient temperature (both temperatures in Kelvin), R0(T0) denotes the cold temperature resistance at T = T0, C is the heat capacitance and \u03b4 is the dissipation constant for the thermistor.\n\nA fundamental phenomenon that has hardly been studied is memristive behaviour in p-n junctions.[15] The memristor plays a crucial role in mimicking the charge storage effect in the diode base, and is also responsible for the conductivity modulation phenomenon (that is so important during forward transients).\n\nCriticisms\n\n[edit]", "Criticisms\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008, a team at HP Labs found experimental evidence for the Chua's memristor based on an analysis of a thin film of titanium dioxide, thus connecting the operation of ReRAM devices to the memristor concept. According to HP Labs, the memristor would operate in the following way: the memristor's electrical resistance is not constant but depends on the current that had previously flowed through the device, i.e., its present resistance depends on how much electric charge has previously flowed through it and in what direction; the device remembers its history\u2014the so-called non-volatility property.[16] When the electric power supply is turned off, the memristor remembers its most recent resistance until it is turned on again.[17][18]", "The HP Labs result was published in the scientific journal Nature.[17][19] Following this claim, Leon Chua has argued that the memristor definition could be generalized to cover all forms of two-terminal non-volatile memory devices based on resistance switching effects.[16] Chua also argued that the memristor is the oldest known circuit element, with its effects predating the resistor, capacitor, and inductor.[20] However, there are doubts as to whether a memristor can actually exist in physical reality.[21][22][23][24] Additionally, some experimental evidence contradicts Chua's generalization since a non-passive nanobattery effect is observable in resistance switching memory.[25] A simple test has been proposed by Pershin and Di Ventra[3] to analyze whether such an ideal or generic memristor does actually exist or is a purely mathematical concept. Up to now,[when?] there seems to be no experimental resistance switching device (ReRAM) which can pass the test.[3][4]", "These devices are intended for applications in nanoelectronic memory devices, computer logic, and neuromorphic/neuromemristive computer architectures.[26][27] In 2013, Hewlett-Packard CTO Martin Fink suggested that memristor memory may become commercially available as early as 2018.[28] In March 2012, a team of researchers from HRL Laboratories and the University of Michigan announced the first functioning memristor array built on a CMOS chip.[29]", "According to the original 1971 definition, the memristor is the fourth fundamental circuit element, forming a non-linear relationship between electric charge and magnetic flux linkage. In 2011, Chua argued for a broader definition that includes all two-terminal non-volatile memory devices based on resistance switching.[16] Williams argued that MRAM, phase-change memory and ReRAM are memristor technologies.[32] Some researchers argued that biological structures such as blood[33] and skin[34][35] fit the definition. Others argued that the memory device under development by HP Labs and other forms of ReRAM are not memristors, but rather part of a broader class of variable-resistance systems,[36] and that a broader definition of memristor is a scientifically unjustifiable land grab that favored HP's memristor patents.[37]", "In 2011, Meuffels and Schroeder noted that one of the early memristor papers included a mistaken assumption regarding ionic conduction.[38] In 2012, Meuffels and Soni discussed some fundamental issues and problems in the realization of memristors.[21] They indicated inadequacies in the electrochemical modeling presented in the Nature article \"The missing memristor found\"[17] because the impact of concentration polarization effects on the behavior of metal\u2212TiO2\u2212x\u2212metal structures under voltage or current stress was not considered.[25]\n\nIn a kind of thought experiment, Meuffels and Soni[21] furthermore revealed a severe inconsistency: If a current-controlled memristor with the so-called non-volatility property[16] exists in physical reality, its behavior would violate Landauer's principle, which places a limit on the minimum amount of energy required to change \"information\" states of a system. This critique was finally adopted by Di Ventra and Pershin[22] in 2013.", "Within this context, Meuffels and Soni[21] pointed to a fundamental thermodynamic principle: Non-volatile information storage requires the existence of free-energy barriers that separate the distinct internal memory states of a system from each other; otherwise, one would be faced with an \"indifferent\" situation, and the system would arbitrarily fluctuate from one memory state to another just under the influence of thermal fluctuations. When unprotected against thermal fluctuations, the internal memory states exhibit some diffusive dynamics, which causes state degradation.[22] The free-energy barriers must therefore be high enough to ensure a low bit-error probability of bit operation.[39] Consequently, there is always a lower limit of energy requirement \u2013 depending on the required bit-error probability \u2013 for intentionally changing a bit value in any memory device.[39][40]\n\nIn the general concept of memristive system the defining equations are (see \u00a7 Theory):", "In the general concept of memristive system the defining equations are (see \u00a7 Theory):\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}y(t)&=g(\\mathbf {x} ,u,t)u(t),\\\\{\\dot {\\mathbf {x} }}&=f(\\mathbf {x} ,u,t),\\end{aligned}}}\n\nwhere u(t) is an input signal, and y(t) is an output signal. The vector\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} }\n\nrepresents a set of n state variables describing the different internal memory states of the device.\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\dot {\\mathbf {x} }}}\n\nis the time-dependent rate of change of the state vector\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} }\n\nwith time.", "is the time-dependent rate of change of the state vector\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} }\n\nwith time.\n\nWhen one wants to go beyond mere curve fitting and aims at a real physical modeling of non-volatile memory elements, e.g., resistive random-access memory devices, one has to keep an eye on the aforementioned physical correlations. To check the adequacy of the proposed model and its resulting state equations, the input signal u(t) can be superposed with a stochastic term \u03be(t), which takes into account the existence of inevitable thermal fluctuations. The dynamic state equation in its general form then finally reads:\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\dot {\\mathbf {x} }}=f(\\mathbf {x} ,u(t)+\\xi (t),t),}", "{\\displaystyle {\\dot {\\mathbf {x} }}=f(\\mathbf {x} ,u(t)+\\xi (t),t),}\n\nwhere \u03be(t) is, e.g., white Gaussian current or voltage noise. On the basis of an analytical or numerical analysis of the time-dependent response of the system towards noise, a decision on the physical validity of the modeling approach can be made, e.g., whether the system would be able to retain its memory states in power-off mode.", "Such an analysis was performed by Di Ventra and Pershin[22] with regard to the genuine current-controlled memristor. As the proposed dynamic state equation provides no physical mechanism enabling such a memristor to cope with inevitable thermal fluctuations, a current-controlled memristor would erratically change its state in course of time just under the influence of current noise.[22][41] Di Ventra and Pershin[22] thus concluded that memristors whose resistance (memory) states depend solely on the current or voltage history would be unable to protect their memory states against unavoidable Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise and permanently suffer from information loss, a so-called \"stochastic catastrophe\". A current-controlled memristor can thus not exist as a solid-state device in physical reality.", "The above-mentioned thermodynamic principle furthermore implies that the operation of two-terminal non-volatile memory devices (e.g. \"resistance-switching\" memory devices (ReRAM)) cannot be associated with the memristor concept, i.e., such devices cannot by itself remember their current or voltage history. Transitions between distinct internal memory or resistance states are of probabilistic nature. The probability for a transition from state {i} to state {j} depends on the height of the free-energy barrier between both states. The transition probability can thus be influenced by suitably driving the memory device, i.e., by \"lowering\" the free-energy barrier for the transition {i}\u2192{j} by means of, for example, an externally applied bias.", "A \"resistance switching\" event can simply be enforced by setting the external bias to a value above a certain threshold value. This is the trivial case, i.e., the free-energy barrier for the transition {i}\u2192{j} is reduced to zero. In case one applies biases below the threshold value, there is still a finite probability that the device will switch in course of time (triggered by a random thermal fluctuation), but \u2013 as one is dealing with probabilistic processes \u2013 it is impossible to predict when the switching event will occur. That is the basic reason for the stochastic nature of all observed resistance-switching (ReRAM) processes. If the free-energy barriers are not high enough, the memory device can even switch without having to do anything.", "When a two-terminal non-volatile memory device is found to be in a distinct resistance state {j} , there exists therefore no physical one-to-one relationship between its present state and its foregoing voltage history. The switching behavior of individual non-volatile memory devices thus cannot be described within the mathematical framework proposed for memristor/memristive systems.", "An extra thermodynamic curiosity arises from the definition that memristors/memristive devices should energetically act like resistors. The instantaneous electrical power entering such a device is completely dissipated as Joule heat to the surrounding, so no extra energy remains in the system after it has been brought from one resistance state xi to another one xj. Thus, the internal energy of the memristor device in state xi, U(V, T, xi), would be the same as in state xj, U(V, T, xj), even though these different states would give rise to different device's resistances, which itself must be caused by physical alterations of the device's material.", "Other researchers noted that memristor models based on the assumption of linear ionic drift do not account for asymmetry between set time (high-to-low resistance switching) and reset time (low-to-high resistance switching) and do not provide ionic mobility values consistent with experimental data. Non-linear ionic-drift models have been proposed to compensate for this deficiency.[42]\n\nA 2014 article from researchers of ReRAM concluded that Strukov's (HP's) initial/basic memristor modeling equations do not reflect the actual device physics well, whereas subsequent (physics-based) models such as Pickett's model or Menzel's ECM model (Menzel is a co-author of that article) have adequate predictability, but are computationally prohibitive. As of 2014, the search continues for a model that balances these issues; the article identifies Chang's and Yakopcic's models as potentially good compromises.[43]", "Martin Reynolds, an electrical engineering analyst with research outfit Gartner, commented that while HP was being sloppy in calling their device a memristor, critics were being pedantic in saying that it was not a memristor.[44]\n\nExperimental tests\n\n[edit]\n\nChua suggested experimental tests to determine if a device may properly be categorized as a memristor:[2]\n\nThe Lissajous curve in the voltage\u2013current plane is a pinched hysteresis loop when driven by any bipolar periodic voltage or current without respect to initial conditions.\n\nThe area of each lobe of the pinched hysteresis loop shrinks as the frequency of the forcing signal increases.\n\nAs the frequency tends to infinity, the hysteresis loop degenerates to a straight line through the origin, whose slope depends on the amplitude and shape", "Metamaterial\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\n\nAsturianu\n\n\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\n\nCatal\u00e0\n\n\u010ce\u0161tina\n\nDansk\n\nDeutsch\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\nEsperanto\n\nEuskara\n\n\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc\n\nFran\u00e7ais\n\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n\n\u0540\u0561\u0575\u0565\u0580\u0565\u0576\n\nItaliano\n\n\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea\n\n\u0d2e\u0d32\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d33\u0d02\n\n\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\n\nNederlands\n\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n\nNorsk bokm\u00e5l\n\n\u067e\u069a\u062a\u0648\n\nPolski\n\nPortugu\u00eas\n\nRom\u00e2n\u0103\n\n\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n\nSloven\u0161\u010dina\n\n\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 / srpski\n\nSuomi\n\nSvenska\n\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e\n\n\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430\n\nTi\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t\n\n\u4e2d\u6587\n\nEdit links\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nMaterials engineered to have properties that have not yet been found in nature", "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nMaterials engineered to have properties that have not yet been found in nature\n\nA metamaterial (from the Greek word \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac meta, meaning \"beyond\" or \"after\", and the Latin word materia, meaning \"matter\" or \"material\") is a type of material engineered to have a property, typically rarely observed in naturally occurring materials, that is derived not from the properties of the base materials but from their newly designed structures. Metamaterials are usually fashioned from multiple materials, such as metals and plastics, and are usually arranged in repeating patterns, at scales that are smaller than the wavelengths of the phenomena they influence. Their precise shape, geometry, size, orientation, and arrangement give them their \"smart\" properties of manipulating electromagnetic, acoustic, or even seismic waves: by blocking, absorbing, enhancing, or bending waves, to achieve benefits that go beyond what is possible with conventional materials.", "Appropriately designed metamaterials can affect waves of electromagnetic radiation or sound in a manner not observed in bulk materials.[3][4][5] Those that exhibit a negative index of refraction for particular wavelengths have been the focus of a large amount of research.[6][7][8] These materials are known as negative-index metamaterials.", "Potential applications of metamaterials are diverse and include sports equipment[9][10] optical filters, medical devices, remote aerospace applications, sensor detection and infrastructure monitoring, smart solar power management, Lasers,[11] crowd control, radomes, high-frequency battlefield communication and lenses for high-gain antennas, improving ultrasonic sensors, and even shielding structures from earthquakes.[12][13][14][15] Metamaterials offer the potential to create super-lenses.[16] Such a lens can allow imaging below the diffraction limit that is the minimum resolution d=\u03bb/(2NA) that can be achieved by conventional lenses having a numerical aperture NA and with illumination wavelength \u03bb. Sub-wavelength optical metamaterials, when integrated with optical recording media, can be used to achieve optical data density higher than limited by diffraction.[17] A form of 'invisibility' was demonstrated using gradient-index materials. Acoustic and seismic metamaterials are also research areas.[12][18]", "Metamaterial research is interdisciplinary and involves such fields as electrical engineering, electromagnetics, classical optics, solid state physics, microwave and antenna engineering, optoelectronics, material sciences, nanoscience and semiconductor engineering.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of metamaterials\n\nExplorations of artificial materials for manipulating electromagnetic waves began at the end of the 19th century. Some of the earliest structures that may be considered metamaterials were studied by Jagadish Chandra Bose, who in 1898 researched substances with chiral properties. Karl Ferdinand Lindman studied wave interaction with metallic helices as artificial chiral media in the early twentieth century.", "In the late 1940s, Winston E. Kock from AT&T Bell Laboratories developed materials that had similar characteristics to metamaterials. In the 1950s and 1960s, artificial dielectrics were studied for lightweight microwave antennas. Microwave radar absorbers were researched in the 1980s and 1990s as applications for artificial chiral media.[4][19][20]\n\nNegative-index materials were first described theoretically by Victor Veselago in 1967.[21] He proved that such materials could transmit light. He showed that the phase velocity could be made anti-parallel to the direction of Poynting vector. This is contrary to wave propagation in naturally occurring materials.[8]", "In 1995, John M. Guerra fabricated a sub-wavelength transparent grating (later called a photonic metamaterial) having 50 nm lines and spaces, and then coupled it with a standard oil immersion microscope objective (the combination later called a super-lens) to resolve a grating in a silicon wafer also having 50 nm lines and spaces. This super-resolved image was achieved with illumination having a wavelength of 650 nm in air.[16]", "In 2000, John Pendry was the first to identify a practical way to make a left-handed metamaterial, a material in which the right-hand rule is not followed.[21] Such a material allows an electromagnetic wave to convey energy (have a group velocity) against its phase velocity. Pendry's idea was that metallic wires aligned along the direction of a wave could provide negative permittivity (dielectric function \u03b5 < 0). Natural materials (such as ferroelectrics) display negative permittivity; the challenge was achieving negative permeability (\u03bc < 0). In 1999 Pendry demonstrated that a split ring (C shape) with its axis placed along the direction of wave propagation could do so. In the same paper, he showed that a periodic array of wires and rings could give rise to a negative refractive index. Pendry also proposed a related negative-permeability design, the Swiss roll.", "In 2000, David R. Smith et al. reported the experimental demonstration of functioning electromagnetic metamaterials by horizontally stacking, periodically, split-ring resonators and thin wire structures. A method was provided in 2002 to realize negative-index metamaterials using artificial lumped-element loaded transmission lines in microstrip technology. In 2003, complex (both real and imaginary parts of) negative refractive index[22] and imaging by flat lens[23] using left handed metamaterials were demonstrated. By 2007, experiments that involved negative refractive index had been conducted by many groups.[3][15] At microwave frequencies, the first, imperfect invisibility cloak was realized in 2006.[24][25][26][27][28]", "From the standpoint of governing equations, contemporary researchers can classify the realm of metamaterials into three primary branches:[29] Electromagnetic/Optical wave metamaterials, other wave metamaterials, and diffusion metamaterials. These branches are characterized by their respective governing equations, which include Maxwell's equations (a wave equation describing transverse waves), other wave equations (for longitudinal and transverse waves), and diffusion equations (pertaining to diffusion processes).[30] Crafted to govern a range of diffusion activities, diffusion metamaterials prioritize diffusion length as their central metric.

It allows considering the local effective material parameters (permittivity and permeability). The resonance effect related to the mutual arrangement of elements is responsible for Bragg scattering, which underlies the physics of photonic crystals, another class of electromagnetic materials. Unlike the local resonances, Bragg scattering and corresponding Bragg stop-band have a low-frequency limit determined by the lattice spacing.

Many microwave metamaterials use split-ring resonators.[5][6]", "Photonic metamaterials are structured on the nanometer scale and manipulate light at optical frequencies. Photonic crystals and frequency-selective surfaces such as diffraction gratings, dielectric mirrors and optical coatings exhibit similarities to subwavelength structured metamaterials. However, these are usually considered distinct from metamaterials, as their function arises from diffraction or interference and thus cannot be approximated as a homogeneous material.[citation needed] However, material structures such as photonic crystals are effective in the visible light spectrum. The middle of the visible spectrum has a wavelength of approximately 560 nm (for sunlight). Photonic crystal structures are generally half this size or smaller, that is < 280 nm.

In such a material, left- and right-rotating elliptical polarizations can propagate at different speeds. When light is transmitted through a layer of magneto-optic material, the result is called the Faraday effect: the polarization plane can be rotated, forming a Faraday rotator. The results of such a reflection are known as the magneto-optic Kerr effect (not to be confused with the nonlinear Kerr effect). Two gyrotropic materials with reversed rotation directions of the two principal polarizations are called optical isomers.", "Joining a slab of ENG material and slab of MNG material resulted in properties such as resonances, anomalous tunneling, transparency and zero reflection.

The material's dispersion relation in wavevector space forms a hyperboloid and therefore it is called a hyperbolic metamaterial. The extreme anisotropy of HMMs leads to directional propagation of light within and on the surface.[40] HMMs have shown various potential applications, such as sensing, reflection modulator,[41] all-optical ultra-fast switching for integrated photonics,[42] imaging, super high resolution and single photon source,[43] steering of optical signals, enhanced plasmon resonance effects.[44]\n\nBandgap\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Photonic crystal, Electronic band structure, and Coupled oscillation", "Bandgap\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Photonic crystal, Electronic band structure, and Coupled oscillation\n\nElectromagnetic bandgap metamaterials (EBG or EBM) control light propagation. This is accomplished either with photonic crystals (PC) or left-handed materials (LHM). PCs can prohibit light propagation altogether. Both classes can allow light to propagate in specific, designed directions and both can be designed with bandgaps at desired frequencies.[45][46] The period size of EBGs is an appreciable fraction of the wavelength, creating constructive and destructive interference.\n\nPC are distinguished from sub-wavelength structures, such as tunable metamaterials, because the PC derives its properties from its bandgap characteristics. PCs are sized to match the wavelength of light, versus other metamaterials that expose sub-wavelength structure. Furthermore, PCs function by diffracting light. In contrast, metamaterial does not use diffraction.[47]", "PCs have periodic inclusions that inhibit wave propagation due to the inclusions' destructive interference from scattering. The photonic bandgap property of PCs makes them the electromagnetic analog of electronic semi-conductor crystals.[48]\n\nEBGs have the goal of creating high quality, low loss, periodic, dielectric structures. An EBG affects photons in the same way semiconductor materials affect electrons. PCs are the perfect bandgap material, because they allow no light propagation.[49] Each unit of the prescribed periodic structure acts like one atom, albeit of a much larger size.[3][49]\n\nEBGs are designed to prevent the propagation of an allocated bandwidth of frequencies, for certain arrival angles and polarizations. Various geometries and structures have been proposed to fabricate EBG's special properties. In practice it is impossible to build a flawless EBG device.[3][4]", "EBGs have been manufactured for frequencies ranging from a few gigahertz (GHz) to a few terahertz (THz), radio, microwave and mid-infrared frequency regions. EBG application developments include a transmission line, woodpiles made of square dielectric bars and several different types of low gain antennas.[3][4]\n\nDouble positive medium\n\n[edit]\n\nDouble positive mediums (DPS) do occur in nature, such as naturally occurring dielectrics.

Such media are denoted as bi-isotropic. Media that exhibit magnetoelectric coupling and that are anisotropic (which is the case for many metamaterial structures[50]), are referred to as bi-anisotropic.[51][52]", "Four material parameters are intrinsic to magnetoelectric coupling of bi-isotropic media.

In this type of media, material parameters do not vary with changes along a rotated coordinate system of measurements. In this sense they are invariant or scalar.[4]\n\nThe intrinsic magnetoelectric parameters, \u03ba and \u03c7, affect the phase of the wave. The effect of the chirality parameter is to split the refractive index. In isotropic media this results in wave propagation only if \u03b5 and \u03bc have the same sign. In bi-isotropic media with \u03c7 assumed to be zero, and \u03ba a non-zero value, different results appear. Either a backward wave or a forward wave can occur.

Nanocellulose may be obtained from natural cellulose fibers through a variety of production processes. This family of materials possesses interesting properties suitable for a wide range of potential applications.\n\nTerminology\n\n[edit]\n\nMicrofibrilated cellulose\n\n[edit]\n\nMicro cellulose (MFC) is a type of nanocellulose that is more heterogeneous than cellulose nanofibers or nanocrystals as it contains a mixture of nano- and micron-scale particles.

They are typically shorter than CNFs, with a typical length of 100 to 1000 nanometers.[8]\n\nBacterial nanocellulose\n\n[edit]", "Bacterial nanocellulose\n\n[edit]\n\nSome cellulose producing bacteria have also been used to produce nanocellulosic materials that are then referred to as bacterial nanocellulose.[9] The most common examples being Medusomyces gisevii (the bacteria involved in the making of Kombucha) and Komagataeibacter xylinus (involve in the fabrication of Nata de coco), see bacterial cellulose for more details. This naming distinction might arise from the very peculiar morphology of these materials compared to the more traditional ones made of wood or cotton cellulose. In practice, bacterial nanocellulosic materials are often larger than their wood or cotton counterparts.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]", "History\n\n[edit]\n\nThe discovery of nanocellulosic materials can be traced back to late 1940s studies on the hydrolysis of cellulose fibers.[2] Eventually it was noticed that cellulose hydrolysis seemed to occur preferentially at some disordered intercrystalline portions of the fibers.[10] This led to the obtention of colloidally stable and highly crystalline nanorods particles.[11][12][13] These particles were first referred to as micelles, before being given multiple names including cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC), or cellulose (nano)whiskers, though this last term is less used today.[2] Later studies by O. A. Battista showed that in milder hydrolysis conditions, the crystalline nanorods stay aggregated as micron size objects.[14][15] This material was later referred to as microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and commercialised under the name Avicel by FMC Corporation.[16]", "Microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) was discovered later, in the 1980s, by Turbak, Snyder and Sandberg at the ITT Rayonier labs in Shelton, Washington.[17][18][19] This terminology was used to describe a gel-like material prepared by passing wood pulp through a Gaulin type milk homogenizer at high temperatures and high pressures followed by ejection impact against a hard surface. In later work, F. W. Herrick at ITT Rayonier Eastern Research Division (ERD) Lab in Whippany also published work on making a dry powder form of the gel.[20][19] Rayonier, as a company, never pursued scale-up and gave free license to whoever wanted to pursue this new use for cellulose.[citation needed] Rather, Turbak et al. pursued 1) finding new uses for the MFC, including using as a thickener and binder in foods, cosmetics, paper formation, textiles, nonwovens, etc. and 2) evaluate swelling and other techniques for lowering the energy requirements for MFC production.[21] The first MFC pilot production plant of MFC was established in", "for lowering the energy requirements for MFC production.[21] The first MFC pilot production plant of MFC was established in 2010 by Innventia AB (Sweden).[22]", "Manufacture\n\n[edit]\n\nCellulose sources\n\n[edit]\n\nNanocellulose materials can be prepared from any natural cellulose source including wood, cotton, agricultural[23] or household wastes,[24] algae,[25] bacteria or tunicate. Wood, in the form of wood pulp is currently the most commonly used starting material for the industrial production of nanocellulosic materials.\n\nNanocellulose fibrils\n\n[edit]\n\nNanocellulose fibrils (MFC and CNFs) may be isolated from the cellulose fibers using mechanical methods that expose the fibers to high shear forces, delaminating them into nano-fibers. For this purpose, high-pressure homogenizers, grinders or microfluidizers can be used.[citation needed] This process consumes very large amounts of energy and values over 30 MWh/tonne are not uncommon.[citation needed]", "To address this problem, sometimes enzymatic/mechanical pre-treatments and introduction of charged groups for example through carboxymethylation or TEMPO-mediated oxidation are used.[26] These pre-treatments can decrease energy consumption below 1 MWh/tonne.[citation needed] \"Nitro-oxidation\" has been developed to prepare carboxycellulose nanofibers directly from raw plant biomass. Owing to fewer processing steps to extract nanocellulose, the nitro-oxidation method has been found to be a cost-effective, less-chemically oriented and efficient method to extract carboxycellulose nanofibers.[27][28] Functionalized nanofibers obtained using nitro-oxidation have been found to be an excellent substrate to remove heavy metal ion impurities such as lead,[29] cadmium,[30] and uranium.[31]\n\nA chemo-mechanical process for production of nanocellulose from cotton linters has been demonstrated with a capacity of 10 kg per day.[32]\n\nCellulose nanocrystals\n\n[edit]", "Cellulose nanocrystals\n\n[edit]\n\nCellulose nanocrystals (CNC) are formed by the acid hydrolysis of native cellulose fibers, most commonly using sulfuric or hydrochloric acid. Disordered sections of native cellulose are hydrolysed and after careful timing, the remaining crystalline sections can be retrieved from the acid solution by centrifugation and dialysis against water. Their final dimensions depend on the cellulose source, its history, the hydrolysis conditions and the purification procedures.[33] CNCs are commercialised by various companies that use different sources and processes, leading to a range of available products.[34][35]\n\nOther cellulose based nanoparticles\n\n[edit]\n\nSpherical shaped carboxycellulose nanoparticles prepared by nitric acid-phosphoric acid treatment are stable in dispersion in its non-ionic form.[36]\n\nStructure and properties\n\n[edit]\n\nDimensions and crystallinity\n\n[edit]", "Structure and properties\n\n[edit]\n\nDimensions and crystallinity\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ultrastructure of nanocellulose derived from various sources has been extensively studied.

The fibrils were found to be rather mono-dispersed mostly with a diameter of ca. 5 nm although occasionally thicker fibril bundles were present.[40] By combining ultrasonication with an \"oxidation pretreatment\", cellulose microfibrils with a lateral dimension below 1 nm has been observed by AFM. The lower end of the thickness dimension is around 0.4 nm, which is related to the thickness of a cellulose monolayer sheet.[41]", "Aggregate widths can be determined by CP/MAS NMR developed by Innventia AB, Sweden, which also has been demonstrated to work for nanocellulose (enzymatic pre-treatment). An average width of 17 nm has been measured with the NMR-method, which corresponds well with SEM and TEM. Using TEM, values of 15 nm have been reported for nanocellulose from carboxymethylated pulp. However, thinner fibrils can also be detected. W\u00e5gberg et al. reported fibril widths of 5\u201315 nm for a nanocellulose with a charge density of about 0.5 meq./g.[42] The group of Isogai reported fibril widths of 3\u20135 nm for TEMPO-oxidized cellulose having a charge density of 1.5 meq./g.[43]", "Pulp chemistry has a significant influence on nanocellulose microstructure. Carboxymethylation increases the numbers of charged groups on the fibril surfaces, making the fibrils easier to liberate and results in smaller and more uniform fibril widths (5\u201315 nm) compared to enzymatically pre-treated nanocellulose, where the fibril widths were 10\u201330 nm.[44] The degree of crystallinity and crystal structure of nanocellulose.

The storage modulus values are particularly high (104 Pa at 3% concentration)[40] compared to results for CNCs (102 Pa at 3% concentration).[45] There is also a strong concentration dependence as the storage modulus increases 5 orders of magnitude if the concentration is increased from 0.125% to 5.9%. Nanocellulose gels are also highly shear thinning (the viscosity is lost upon introduction of the shear forces). The shear-thinning behaviour is particularly useful in a range of different coating applications.[40]", "It is pseudo-plastic and exhibits thixotropy, the property of certain gels or fluids that are thick (viscous) under normal conditions, but become less viscous when shaken or agitated. When the shearing forces are removed the gel regains much of its original state.\n\nMechanical properties\n\n[edit]\n\nCrystalline cellulose has a stiffness about 140\u2013220 GPa, comparable with that of Kevlar and better than that of glass fiber, both of which are used commercially to reinforce plastics. Films made from nanocellulose have high strength (over 200 MPa), high stiffness (around 20 GPa)[46] but lack of high strain[clarification needed] (12%). Its strength/weight ratio is 8 times that of stainless steel.[47] Fibers made from nanocellulose have high strength (up to 1.57 GPa) and stiffness (up to 86 GPa).[48]\n\nBarrier properties\n\n[edit]", "Barrier properties\n\n[edit]\n\nIn semi-crystalline polymers, the crystalline regions are considered to be gas impermeable. Due to relatively high crystallinity,[44] in combination with the ability of the nanofibers to form a dense network held together by strong inter-fibrillar bonds (high cohesive energy density), it has been suggested that nanocellulose might act as a barrier material.[43][49][50] Although the number of reported oxygen permeability values are limited, reports attribute high oxygen barrier properties to nanocellulose films. One study reported an oxygen permeability of 0.0006 (cm3 \u03bcm)/(m2 day kPa) for a ca. 5 \u03bcm thin nanocellulose film at 23 \u00b0C and 0% RH.[49] In a related study, a more than 700-fold decrease in oxygen permeability of a polylactide (PLA) film when a nanocellulose layer was added to the PLA surface was reported.[43]", "The influence of nanocellulose film density and porosity on film oxygen permeability has been explored.[51] Some authors have reported significant porosity in nanocellulose films,[52][46][53] which seems to be in contradiction with high oxygen barrier properties, whereas Aulin et al.[49] measured a nanocellulose film density close to density of crystalline cellulose (cellulose I\u00df crystal structure, 1.63 g/cm3)[54] indicating a very dense film with a porosity close to zero.\n\nChanging the surface functionality of the cellulose nanoparticle can also affect the permeability of nanocellulose films. Films constituted of negatively charged CNCs could effectively reduce permeation of negatively charged ions, while leaving neutral ions virtually unaffected. Positively charged ions were found to accumulate in the membrane.[55]", "Multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance is one of the methods to study barrier properties of natural, modified or coated nanocellulose. The different antifouling, moisture, solvent, antimicrobial barrier formulation quality can be measured on the nanoscale. The adsorption kinetics as well as the degree of swelling can be measured in real-time and label-free.[56][57]\n\nLiquid crystals, colloidal glasses, and hydrogels\n\n[edit]", "Liquid crystals, colloidal glasses, and hydrogels\n\n[edit]\n\nOwed to their anisotropic shape and surface charge, nanocelluloses (mostly rigid CNCs) have a high excluded volume and self-assemble into cholesteric liquid crystals beyond a critical volume fraction.[58] Nanocellulose liquid crystals are left-handed due to the right-handed twist on particle level.[59] Nanocellulose phase behavior is susceptible to ionic charge screening. An increase in ionic strength induces the arrest of nanocellulose dispersions into attractive glasses.[60] At further increasing ionic strength, nanocelluloses aggregate into hydrogels.[61] The interactions within nanocelluloses are weak and reversible, wherefore nanocellulose suspensions and hydrogels are self-healing and may be applied as injectable materials[62] or 3D printing inks.[63]\n\nBulk foams and aerogels\n\n[edit]", "Nanocellulose can also be used to make aerogels/foams, either homogeneously or in composite formulations. Nanocellulose-based foams are being studied for packaging applications in order to replace polystyrene-based foams. Svagan et al. showed that nanocellulose has the ability to reinforce starch foams by using a freeze-drying technique.[64] The advantage of using nanocellulose instead of wood-based pulp fibers is that the nanofibrils can reinforce the thin cells in the starch foam. Moreover, it is possible to prepare pure nanocellulose aerogels applying various freeze-drying and super critical CO 2 drying techniques. Aerogels and foams can be used as porous templates.[65][66] Tough ultra-high porosity foams prepared from cellulose I nanofibril suspensions were studied by Sehaqui et al. a wide range of mechanical properties including compression was obtained by controlling density and nanofibril interaction in the foams.[67] CNCs could also be made to gel in water under low power sonication giving rise to", "and nanofibril interaction in the foams.[67] CNCs could also be made to gel in water under low power sonication giving rise to aerogels with the highest reported surface area (>600m2/g) and lowest shrinkage during drying (6.5%) of cellulose aerogels.[66] In another study by Aulin et al.,[68] the formation of structured porous aerogels of nanocellulose by freeze-drying was demonstrated. The density and surface texture of the aerogels was tuned by selecting the concentration of the nanocellulose dispersions before freeze-drying. Chemical vapour deposition of a fluorinated silane was used to uniformly coat the aerogel to tune their wetting properties towards non-polar liquids/oils. The authors demonstrated that it is possible to switch the wettability behaviour of the cellulose surfaces between super-wetting and super-repellent, using different scales of roughness and porosity created by the freeze-drying technique and change of concentration of the nanocellulose dispersion. Structured porous cellulose foams", "by the freeze-drying technique and change of concentration of the nanocellulose dispersion. Structured porous cellulose foams can however also be obtained by utilizing the freeze-drying technique on cellulose generated by Gluconobacter strains of bacteria, which bio-synthesize open porous networks of cellulose fibers with relatively large amounts of nanofibrils dispersed inside. Olsson et al.[69] demonstrated that these networks can be further impregnated with metalhydroxide/oxide precursors, which can readily be transformed into grafted magnetic nanoparticles along the cellulose nanofibers. The magnetic cellulose foam may allow for a number of novel applications of nanocellulose and the first remotely actuated magnetic super sponges absorbing 1 gram of water within a 60 mg cellulose aerogel foam were reported. Notably, these highly porous foams (>98% air) can be compressed into strong magnetic nanopapers, which may find use as functional membranes in various applications.", "Pickering emulsions and foams\n\n[edit]", "Nanocelluloses can stabilize emulsions and foams by a Pickering mechanism, i.e. they adsorb at the oil-water or air-water interface and prevent their energetic unfavorable contact. Nanocelluloses form oil-in-water emulsions with a droplet size in the range of 4-10 \u03bcm that are stable for months and can resist high temperatures and changes in pH.[70][71] Nanocelluloses decrease the oil-water interface tension[72] and their surface charge induces electrostatic repulsion within emulsion droplets. Upon salt-induced charge screening the droplets aggregate but do not undergo coalescence, indicating strong steric stabilization.[73] The emulsion droplets even remain stable in the human stomach and resist gastric lipolysis, thereby delaying lipid absorption and satiation.[74][75] In contrast to emulsions, native nanocelluloses are generally not suitable for the Pickering stabilization of foams, which is attributed to their primarily hydrophilic surface properties that results in an unfavorable contact angle below 90\u00b0", "which is attributed to their primarily hydrophilic surface properties that results in an unfavorable contact angle below 90\u00b0 (they are preferably wetted by the aqueous phase).[76] Using hydrophobic surface modifications or polymer grafting, the surface hydrophobicity and contact angle of nanocelluloses can be increased, allowing also the Pickering stabilization of foams.[77] By further increasing the surface hydrophobicity, inverse water-in-oil emulsions can be obtained, which denotes a contact angle higher than 90\u00b0.[78][79] It was further demonstrated that nanocelluloses can stabilize water-in-water emulsions in presence of two incompatible water-soluble polymers.[80]", "Cellulose nanofiber plate\n\n[edit]", "[edit]\n\nA bottom up approach can be used to create a high-performance bulk material with low density, high strength and toughness, and great thermal dimensional stability: cellulose nanofiber plate (CNFP). Cellulose nanofiber hydrogel is created by biosynthesis. The hydrogels can then be treated with a polymer solution or by surface modification and then are hot-pressed at 80 \u00b0C. The result is bulk material with excellent machinability. \u201cThe ultrafine nanofiber network structure in CNFP results in more extensive hydrogen bonding, the high in-plane orientation, and \u201cthree way branching points\u201d of the microfibril networks\u201d.[81] This structure gives CNFP its high strength by distributing stress and adding barriers to crack formation and propagation. The weak link in this structure is bond between the pressed layers which can lead to delamination. To reduce delamination, the hydrogel can be treated with silicic acid, which creates strong covalent cross-links between layers during hot pressing.[81]", "Surface modification\n\n[edit]\n\nThe surface modification of nanocellulose is currently receiving a large amount of attention.[82] Nanocellulose displays a high concentration of hydroxyl groups at the surface which can be reacted. However, hydrogen bonding strongly affects the reactivity of the surface hydroxyl groups. In addition, impurities at the surface of nanocellulose such as glucosidic and lignin fragments need to be removed before surface modification to obtain acceptable reproducibility between different batches.[83]\n\nSafety aspects\n\n[edit]", "Safety aspects\n\n[edit]\n\nProcessing of nanocellulose does not cause significant exposure to fine particles during friction grinding or spray drying. No evidence of inflammatory effects or cytotoxicity on mouse or human macrophages can be observed after exposure to nanocellulose. The results of toxicity studies suggest that nanocellulose is not cytotoxic and does not cause any effects on inflammatory system in macrophages. In addition, nanocellulose is not acutely toxic to Vibrio fischeri in environmentally relevant concentrations.[84]\n\nDespite intensified research on oral food or pharmaceutical formulations containing nanocelluloses they are not generally recognized as safe. Nanocelluloses were demonstrated to exhibit limited toxicity and oxidative stress in in vitro intestinal epithelium[85][86][87] or animal models.[88][89][90]\n\nPotential applications\n\n[edit]", "Potential applications\n\n[edit]\n\nThe properties of nanocellulose (e.g. mechanical properties, film-forming properties, viscosity etc.) makes it an interesting material for many applications.[91]\n\nPaper and paperboard\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the area of paper and paperboard manufacture, nanocelluloses are expected to enhance the fiber-fiber bond strength and, hence, have a strong reinforcement effect on paper materials.[94][95][96] Nanocellulose may be useful as a barrier in grease-proof type of papers and as a wet-end additive to enhance retention, dry and wet strength in commodity type of paper and board products.[97][98][99][100] It has been shown", "Neuromorphic computing\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\n\n\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\n\nCatal\u00e0\n\nDeutsch\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\n\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc\n\nFran\u00e7ais\n\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n\nItaliano\n\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n\nNorsk bokm\u00e5l\n\nPortugu\u00eas\n\n\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 / srpski\n\n\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430\n\nEdit links\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n(Redirected from Neuromorphic engineering)\n\nIntegrated circuit technology\n\nNeuromorphic computing is an approach to computing that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.[1][2] A neuromorphic computer/chip is any device that uses physical artificial neurons to do computations.[3][4] In recent times, the term neuromorphic has been used to describe analog, digital, mixed-mode analog/digital VLSI, and software systems that implement models of neural systems (for perception, motor control, or multisensory integration). Recent advances have even discovered ways to mimic the human nervous system through liquid solutions of chemical systems.[5]", "A key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is understanding how the morphology of individual neurons, circuits, applications, and overall architectures creates desirable computations, affects how information is represented, influences robustness to damage, incorporates learning and development, adapts to local change (plasticity), and facilitates evolutionary change.\n\nNeuromorphic engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that takes inspiration from biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, and electronic engineering[4] to design artificial neural systems, such as vision systems, head-eye systems, auditory processors, and autonomous robots, whose physical architecture and design principles are based on those of biological nervous systems.[6] One of the first applications for neuromorphic engineering was proposed by Carver Mead[7] in the late 1980s.\n\nNeurological inspiration\n\n[edit]", "Neurological inspiration\n\n[edit]\n\nNeuromorphic engineering is for now set apart by the inspiration it takes from what we[who?] know about the structure and operations of the brain. Neuromorphic engineering translates what we know about the brain's function into computer systems. Work has mostly focused on replicating the analog nature of biological computation and the role of neurons in cognition.[citation needed]\n\nThe biological processes of neurons and their synapses are dauntingly complex, and thus very difficult to artificially simulate. A key feature of biological brains is that all of the processing in neurons uses analog chemical signals. This makes it hard to replicate brains in computers because the current generation of computers is completely digital. However, the characteristics of these chemical signals can be abstracted into mathematical functions that closely capture the essence of the neuron's operations.[citation needed]", "The goal of neuromorphic computing is not to perfectly mimic the brain and all of its functions, but instead to extract what is known of its structure and operations to be used in a practical computing system. No neuromorphic system will claim nor attempt to reproduce every element of neurons and synapses, but all adhere to the idea that computation is highly distributed throughout a series of small computing elements analogous to a neuron. While this sentiment is standard, researchers chase this goal with different methods.[8] Anatomical neural wiring diagrams that are being imaged by electron microscopy[9] and functional neural connection maps that could be potentially obtained via intracellular recording at scale[10] can be used to better inspire, if not exactly mimicked, neuromorphic computing systems with more details.\n\nImplementation\n\n[edit]", "Implementation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe implementation of neuromorphic computing on the hardware level can be realized by oxide-based memristors,[11] spintronic memories, threshold switches, transistors,[12][4] among others. The implementation details overlap with the concepts of Artificial Immune Systems. Training software-based neuromorphic systems of spiking neural networks can be achieved using error backpropagation, e.g. using Python-based frameworks such as snnTorch,[13] or using canonical learning rules from the biological learning literature, e.g. using BindsNet.[14]\n\nExamples\n\n[edit]\n\nThis section may be too long to read and navigate comfortably .

( September 2022 )", "As early as 2006, researchers at Georgia Tech published a field programmable neural array.[15] This chip was the first in a line of increasingly complex arrays of floating gate transistors that allowed programmability of charge on the gates of MOSFETs to model the channel-ion characteristics of neurons in the brain and was one of the first cases of a silicon programmable array of neurons.\n\nIn November 2011, a group of MIT researchers created a computer chip that mimics the analog, ion-based communication in a synapse between two neurons using 400 transistors and standard CMOS manufacturing techniques.[16][17]\n\nIn June 2012, spintronic researchers at Purdue University presented a paper on the design of a neuromorphic chip using lateral spin valves and memristors. They argue that the architecture works similarly to neurons and can therefore be used to test methods of reproducing the brain's processing. In addition, these chips are significantly more energy-efficient than conventional ones.[18]", "Research at HP Labs on Mott memristors has shown that while they can be non-volatile, the volatile behavior exhibited at temperatures significantly below the phase transition temperature can be exploited to fabricate a neuristor,[19] a biologically-inspired device that mimics behavior found in neurons.[19] In September 2013, they presented models and simulations that show how the spiking behavior of these neuristors can be used to form the components required for a Turing machine.[20]\n\nNeurogrid, built by Brains in Silicon at Stanford University,[21] is an example of hardware designed using neuromorphic engineering principles. The circuit board is composed of 16 custom-designed chips, referred to as NeuroCores. Each NeuroCore's analog circuitry is designed to emulate neural elements for 65536 neurons, maximizing energy efficiency. The emulated neurons are connected using digital circuitry designed to maximize spiking throughput.[22][23]", "A research project with implications for neuromorphic engineering is the Human Brain Project that is attempting to simulate a complete human brain in a supercomputer using biological data. It is made up of a group of researchers in neuroscience, medicine, and computing.[24] Henry Markram, the project's co-director, has stated that the project proposes to establish a foundation to explore and understand the brain and its diseases, and to use that knowledge to build new computing technologies. The three primary goals of the project are to better understand how the pieces of the brain fit and work together, to understand how to objectively diagnose and treat brain diseases and to use the understanding of the human brain to develop neuromorphic computers. Since the simulation of a complete human brain will require a powerful supercomputer, the current focus on neuromorphic computers is being encouraged.[25] $1.3 billion has been allocated to the project by The European Commission.[26]", "Other research with implications for neuromorphic engineering involve the BRAIN Initiative[27] and the TrueNorth chip from IBM.[28] Neuromorphic devices have also been demonstrated using nanocrystals, nanowires, and conducting polymers.[29] There also is development of a memristive device for quantum neuromorphic architectures.[30] In 2022, researchers at MIT have reported the development of brain-inspired artificial synapses, using the ion proton (H+ ), for 'analog deep learning'.[31][32]\n\nIntel unveiled its neuromorphic research chip, called \"Loihi\", in October 2017. The chip uses an asynchronous spiking neural network (SNN) to implement adaptive self-modifying event-driven fine-grained parallel computations used to implement learning and inference with high efficiency.[33][34]", "IMEC, a Belgium-based nanoelectronics research center, demonstrated the world's first self-learning neuromorphic chip. The brain-inspired chip, based on OxRAM technology, has the capability of self-learning and has been demonstrated to have the ability to compose music.[35] IMEC released the 30-second tune composed by the prototype. The chip was sequentially loaded with songs in the same time signature and style. The songs were old Belgian and French flute minuets, from which the chip learned the rules at play and then applied them.[36]\n\nThe Blue Brain Project, led by Henry Markram, aims to build biologically detailed digital reconstructions and simulations of the mouse brain. The Blue Brain Project has created in silico models of rodent brains, while attempting to replicate as many details about its biology as possible. The supercomputer-based simulations offer new perspectives on understanding the structure and functions of the brain.", "The European Union funded a series of projects at the University of Heidelberg, which led to the development of BrainScaleS (brain-inspired multiscale computation in neuromorphic hybrid systems), a hybrid analog neuromorphic supercomputer located at Heidelberg University, Germany. It was developed as part of the Human Brain Project neuromorphic computing platform and is the complement to the SpiNNaker supercomputer (which is based on digital technology). The architecture used in BrainScaleS mimics biological neurons and their connections on a physical level; additionally, since the components are made of silicon, these model neurons operate on average 864 times (24 hours of real time is 100 seconds in the machine simulation) faster than that of their biological counterparts.[37]", "In 2019, the European Union funded the project \"Neuromorphic quantum computing\"[38] exploring the use of neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations. Neuromorphic quantum computing[39] (abbreviated as 'n.quantum computing') is an unconventional computing type of computing that uses neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations.[40][41] It was suggested that quantum algorithms, which are algorithms that run on a realistic model of quantum computation, can be computed equally efficiently with neuromorphic quantum computing.[42][43][44][45][46] Both, traditional quantum computing and neuromorphic quantum computing are physics-based unconventional computing approaches to computations and do not follow the von Neumann architecture. They both construct a system (a circuit) that represents the physical problem at hand, and then leverage their respective physics properties of the system to seek the \"minimum\". Neuromorphic quantum computing and quantum computing share similar physical properties", "of the system to seek the \"minimum\". Neuromorphic quantum computing and quantum computing share similar physical properties during computation.[46][47]", "Brainchip announced in October 2021 that it was taking orders for its Akida AI Processor Development Kits[48] and in January 2022 that it was taking orders for its Akida AI Processor PCIe boards,[49] making it the world's first commercially available neuromorphic processor.\n\nNeuromemristive systems\n\n[edit]\n\nNeuromemristive systems are a subclass of neuromorphic computing systems that focuses on the use of memristors to implement neuroplasticity. While neuromorphic engineering focuses on mimicking biological behavior, neuromemristive systems focus on abstraction.[50] For example, a neuromemristive system may replace the details of a cortical microcircuit's behavior with an abstract neural network model.[51]", "There exist several neuron inspired threshold logic functions[11] implemented with memristors that have applications in high level pattern recognition applications. Some of the applications reported recently include speech recognition,[52] face recognition[53] and object recognition.[54] They also find applications in replacing conventional digital logic gates.[55][56]\n\nFor (quasi)ideal passive memristive circuits, the evolution of the memristive memories can be written in a closed form (Caravelli\u2013Traversa\u2013Di Ventra equation):[57][58]\n\nas a function of the properties of the physical memristive network and the external sources. The equation is valid for the case of the Williams-Strukov original toy model, as in the case of ideal memristors,\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha =0}\n\n. However, the hypothesis of the existence of an ideal memristor is debatable.[59] In the equation above,\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n\nis the \"forgetting\" time scale constant, typically associated to memory volatility, while", "{\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n\nis the \"forgetting\" time scale constant, typically associated to memory volatility, while\n\n{\\displaystyle \\chi ={\\frac {R_{\\text{off}}-R_{\\text{on}}}{R_{\\text{off}}}}}\n\nis the ratio of off and on values of the limit resistances of the memristors,\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\vec {S}}}\n\nis the vector of the sources of the circuit and\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Omega }\n\nis a projector on the fundamental loops of the circuit.

This equation thus requires adding extra constraints on the memory values in order to be reliable.", "It has been recently shown that the equation above exhibits tunneling phenomena and used to study Lyapunov functions.[60][58]\n\nNeuromorphic sensors\n\n[edit]\n\nThe concept of neuromorphic systems can be extended to sensors (not just to computation). An example of this applied to detecting light is the retinomorphic sensor or, when employed in an array, the event camera. An event camera's pixels all register changes in brightness levels individually, which makes these cameras comparable to human eyesight in their theoretical power consumption.[61] In 2022, researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research reported an organic artificial spiking neuron that exhibits the signal diversity of biological neurons while operating in the biological wetware, thus enabling in-situ neuromorphic sensing and biointerfacing applications.[62][63]\n\nMilitary applications\n\n[edit]", "Military applications\n\n[edit]\n\nThis section does not cite any sources .

JAIC intends to rely heavily on neuromorphic technology to connect \"every sensor (to) every shooter\" within a network of neuromorphic-enabled units.\n\nEthical and legal considerations\n\n[edit]", "Ethical and legal considerations\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile the interdisciplinary concept of neuromorphic engineering is relatively new, many of the same ethical considerations apply to neuromorphic systems as apply to human-like machines and artificial intelligence in general. However, the fact that neuromorphic systems are designed to mimic a human brain gives rise to unique ethical questions surrounding their usage.", "However, the practical debate is that neuromorphic hardware as well as artificial \"neural networks\" are immensely simplified models of how the brain operates or processes information at a much lower complexity in terms of size and functional technology and a much more regular structure in terms of connectivity. Comparing neuromorphic chips to the brain is a very crude comparison similar to comparing a plane to a bird just because they both have wings and a tail. The fact is that biological neural cognitive systems are many orders of magnitude more energy- and compute-efficient than current state-of-the-art AI and neuromorphic engineering is an attempt to narrow this gap by inspiring from the brain's mechanism just like many engineering designs have bio-inspired features.\n\nSocial concerns\n\n[edit]", "Social concerns\n\n[edit]\n\nSignificant ethical limitations may be placed on neuromorphic engineering due to public perception.[64] Special Eurobarometer 382: Public Attitudes Towards Robots, a survey conducted by the European Commission, found that 60% of European Union citizens wanted a ban of robots in the care of children, the elderly, or the disabled. Furthermore, 34% were in favor of a ban on robots in education, 27% in healthcare, and 20% in leisure. The European Commission classifies these areas as notably \"human.\" The report cites increased public concern with robots that are able to mimic or replicate human functions. Neuromorphic engineering, by definition, is designed to replicate the function of the human brain.[65]", "The social concerns surrounding neuromorphic engineering are likely to become even more profound in the future. The European Commission found that EU citizens between the ages of 15 and 24 are more likely to think of robots as human-like (as opposed to instrument-like) than EU citizens over the age of 55. When presented an image of a robot that had been defined as human-like, 75% of EU citizens aged 15\u201324 said it corresponded with the idea they had of robots while only 57% of EU citizens over the age of 55 responded the same way. The human-like nature of neuromorphic systems, therefore, could place them in the categories of robots many EU citizens would like to see banned in the future.[65]\n\nPersonhood\n\n[edit]", "Personhood\n\n[edit]\n\nAs neuromorphic systems have become increasingly advanced, some scholars[who?] have advocated for granting personhood rights to these systems. Daniel Lim, a critic of technology development in the Human Brain Project, which aims to advance brain-inspired computing, has argued that advancement in neuromorphic computing could lead to machine consciousness or personhood.[66] If these systems are to be treated as people, then many tasks humans perform using neuromorphic systems, including their termination, may be morally impermissible as these acts would violate their autonomy.[66]\n\nOwnership and property rights\n\n[edit]", "Ownership and property rights\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is significant legal debate around property rights and artificial intelligence.

This process may have application in quantum communication networks and quantum computing.\n\nConcept\n\n[edit]\n\nBasic principles\n\n[edit]\n\nEntanglement swapping has two pairs of entangled particles: (A, B) and (C, D). Pair of particles (A, B) is initially entangled, as is the pair (C, D). The pair (B, C) taken from the original pairs, is projected onto one of the four possible Bell states, a process called a Bell state measurement. The unmeasured pair of particles (A, D) can become entangled. This effect happens without any previous direct interaction between particles A and D.[2][3]", "Entanglement swapping is a form of quantum teleportation. In quantum teleportation, the unknown state of a particle can be sent from one location to another using the combination of a quantum and classical channel. The unknown state is projected by Alice onto a Bell state and the result is communicated to Bob through the classical channel.[4] In entanglement swapping, the state from one of the two sources is the quantum channel of teleportation and the state from the other source is the unknown being sent to Bob.[5]: 876\n\nMathematical representation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe mathematical expression for the swapping process is:[5]: 876\n\n{\\displaystyle \\left|\\psi \\right\\rangle _{AB}\\otimes \\left|\\psi \\right\\rangle _{CD}\\xrightarrow {{\\text{BSM}}_{BC}} \\left|\\psi \\right\\rangle _{AD}}\n\nIn this expression,\n\n{\\displaystyle \\left|\\psi \\right\\rangle _{XY}}", "In this expression,\n\n{\\displaystyle \\left|\\psi \\right\\rangle _{XY}}\n\nrefers to an entangled state of pair of particles (X,Y) while BSM indicates Bell state measurement. A Bell state is one of four specific states of representing two particles with maximal entanglement; a Bell state measurement projects a quantum state onto this basis set.[6]: 813\n\nPotential applications\n\n[edit]\n\nQuantum cryptography\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the field of quantum cryptography, it helps secure communication channels better. By utilizing swapped entanglements between particles' pairs, it is possible to generate secure encryption keys that should be protected against eavesdropping.[7]\n\nQuantum networks\n\n[edit]\n\nEntanglement swapping also serves as a core technology for designing quantum networks, where many nodes-like quantum computers or communication points-link through these special connections made by entangled links. These networks may support safely transferring quantum information over long routes.[8]", "Quantum repeaters and long-distance communication\n\n[edit]\n\nEntanglement swapping may allow the construction of quantum repeaters to stretch out quantum communication networks by allowing entanglement to be shared over long distances. Performing entanglement swapping at certain points acts like relaying information without loss.[9][10]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBernard Yurke and David Stoler showed theoretically in 1992 that entanglement does not require interaction of the final measured particles.[11][5]: 876 [6]: 786 Using a three component Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013Zeilinger state, they showed that Mermin's device, a thought experiment model designed to explain entanglement, was equivalent to an EPR experiment where the correlated particles had never directly interacted.[11]", "The term entanglement swapping was coined by physicists Marek \u017bukowski, Anton Zeilinger, Michael A. Horne, and Artur K. Ekert in their 1993 paper. They refined the concept to show one can extend entanglement from one particle pair to another using a method called Bell state measurement.[12]\n\nIn 1998 Jian-Wei Pan working in Zeilinger's group conducted the first experiment on entanglement swapping. They used entangled photons to show successful transfer of entanglement between pairs that never interacted.[3] Later experiments took this further, making it work over longer distances and with more complex quantum states.[citation needed]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\n^ Hu, Xiao-Min; Guo, Yu; Liu, Bi-Heng; Li, Chuan-Feng; Guo, Guang-Can (June 2023). \"Progress in quantum teleportation\".

Spintronic systems are most often realised in dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) and Heusler alloys and are of particular interest in the field of quantum computing and neuromorphic computing, upon which leads to integrated research requirements around Hyperdimensional Computation.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]", "History\n\n[edit]\n\nSpintronics emerged from discoveries in the 1980s concerning spin-dependent electron transport phenomena in solid-state devices. This includes the observation of spin-polarized electron injection from a ferromagnetic metal to a normal metal by Johnson and Silsbee (1985)[5] and the discovery of giant magnetoresistance independently by Albert Fert et al.[6] and Peter Gr\u00fcnberg et al. (1988).[7] The origin of spintronics can be traced to the ferromagnet/superconductor tunneling experiments pioneered by Meservey and Tedrow and initial experiments on magnetic tunnel junctions by Julliere in the 1970s.[8] The use of semiconductors for spintronics began with the theoretical proposal of a spin field-effect-transistor by Datta and Das in 1990[9] and of the electric dipole spin resonance by Rashba in 1960.[10]\n\nTheory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Spin (physics)", "Theory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Spin (physics)\n\nThe spin of the electron is an intrinsic angular momentum that is separate from the angular momentum due to its orbital motion. The magnitude of the projection of the electron's spin along an arbitrary axis is\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\hbar }\n\n, implying that the electron acts as a fermion by the spin-statistics theorem. Like orbital angular momentum, the spin has an associated magnetic moment, the magnitude of which is expressed as\n\nIn a solid, the spins of many electrons can act together to affect the magnetic and electronic properties of a material, for example endowing it with a permanent magnetic moment as in a ferromagnet.", "In many materials, electron spins are equally present in both the up and the down state, and no transport properties are dependent on spin. A spintronic device requires generation or manipulation of a spin-polarized population of electrons, resulting in an excess of spin up or spin down electrons. The polarization of any spin dependent property X can be written as\n\nA net spin polarization can be achieved either through creating an equilibrium energy split between spin up and spin down. Methods include putting a material in a large magnetic field (Zeeman effect), the exchange energy present in a ferromagnet or forcing the system out of equilibrium. The period of time that such a non-equilibrium population can be maintained is known as the spin lifetime,\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tau }\n\nIn a diffusive conductor, a spin diffusion length\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lambda }", "{\\displaystyle \\tau }\n\nIn a diffusive conductor, a spin diffusion length\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n\ncan be defined as the distance over which a non-equilibrium spin population can propagate. Spin lifetimes of conduction electrons in metals are relatively short (typically less than 1 nanosecond). An important research area is devoted to extending this lifetime to technologically relevant timescales.\n\nThe mechanisms of decay for a spin polarized population can be broadly classified as spin-flip scattering and spin dephasing. Spin-flip scattering is a process inside a solid that does not conserve spin, and can therefore switch an incoming spin up state into an outgoing spin down state. Spin dephasing is the process wherein a population of electrons with a common spin state becomes less polarized over time due to different rates of electron spin precession. In confined structures, spin dephasing can be suppressed, leading to spin lifetimes of milliseconds in semiconductor quantum dots at low temperatures.", "Superconductors can enhance central effects in spintronics such as magnetoresistance effects, spin lifetimes and dissipationless spin-currents.[11][12]\n\nThe simplest method of generating a spin-polarised current in a metal is to pass the current through a ferromagnetic material. The most common applications of this effect involve giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices. A typical GMR device consists of at least two layers of ferromagnetic materials separated by a spacer layer. When the two magnetization vectors of the ferromagnetic layers are aligned, the electrical resistance will be lower (so a higher current flows at constant voltage) than if the ferromagnetic layers are anti-aligned. This constitutes a magnetic field sensor.\n\nTwo variants of GMR have been applied in devices: (1) current-in-plane (CIP), where the electric current flows parallel to the layers and (2) current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP), where the electric current flows in a direction perpendicular to the layers.", "Other metal-based spintronics devices:\n\nTunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), where CPP transport is achieved by using quantum-mechanical tunneling of electrons through a thin insulator separating ferromagnetic layers.\n\nSpin-transfer torque, where a current of spin-polarized electrons is used to control the magnetization direction of ferromagnetic electrodes in the device.\n\nSpin-wave logic devices carry information in the phase. Interference and spin-wave scattering can perform logic operations.\n\nSpintronic-logic devices\n\n[edit]\n\nNon-volatile spin-logic devices to enable scaling are being extensively studied.[13] Spin-transfer, torque-based logic devices that use spins and magnets for information processing have been proposed.[14][15] These devices are part of the ITRS exploratory road map. Logic-in memory applications are already in the development stage.[16][17] A 2017 review article can be found in Materials Today.[4]", "A generalized circuit theory for spintronic integrated circuits has been proposed[18] so that the physics of spin transport can be utilized by SPICE developers and subsequently by circuit and system designers for the exploration of spintronics for \"beyond CMOS computing\".\n\nApplications\n\n[edit]\n\nRead heads of magnetic hard drives are based on the GMR or TMR effect.\n\nMotorola developed a first-generation 256 kb magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) based on a single magnetic tunnel junction and a single transistor that has a read/write cycle of under 50 nanoseconds.[19] Everspin has since developed a 4 Mb version.[20] Two second-generation MRAM techniques are in development: thermal-assisted switching (TAS)[21] and spin-transfer torque (STT).[22]\n\nAnother design, racetrack memory, a novel memory architecture proposed by Dr. Stuart S. P. Parkin, encodes information in the direction of magnetization between domain walls of a ferromagnetic wire.", "In 2012, persistent spin helices of synchronized electrons were made to persist for more than a nanosecond, a 30-fold increase over earlier efforts, and longer than the duration of a modern processor clock cycle.[23]\n\nSemiconductor-based spintronic devices\n\n[edit]\n\nDoped semiconductor materials display dilute ferromagnetism. In recent years, dilute magnetic oxides (DMOs) including ZnO based DMOs and TiO2-based DMOs have been the subject of numerous experimental and computational investigations.[24][25] Non-oxide ferromagnetic semiconductor sources (like manganese-doped gallium arsenide (Ga,Mn)As),[26] increase the interface resistance with a tunnel barrier,[27] or using hot-electron injection.[28]\n\nSpin detection in semiconductors has been addressed with multiple techniques:\n\nFaraday/Kerr rotation of transmitted/reflected photons[29]\n\nCircular polarization analysis of electroluminescence[30]\n\nNonlocal spin valve (adapted from Johnson and Silsbee's work with metals)[31]\n\nBallistic spin filtering[32]", "Nonlocal spin valve (adapted from Johnson and Silsbee's work with metals)[31]\n\nBallistic spin filtering[32]\n\nThe latter technique was used to overcome the lack of spin-orbit interaction and materials issues to achieve spin transport in silicon.[33]\n\nBecause external magnetic fields (and stray fields from magnetic contacts) can cause large Hall effects and magnetoresistance in semiconductors (which mimic spin-valve effects), the only conclusive evidence of spin transport in semiconductors is demonstration of spin precession and dephasing in a magnetic field non-collinear to the injected spin orientation, called the Hanle effect.\n\nApplications\n\n[edit]\n\nApplications using spin-polarized electrical injection have shown threshold current reduction and controllable circularly polarized coherent light output.[34] Examples include semiconductor lasers.

In modern MRAM, detection and manipulation of ferromagnetic order by magnetic fields has largely been abandoned in favor of more efficient and scalable reading and writing by electrical current. Methods of reading and writing information by current rather than fields are also being investigated in antiferromagnets as fields are ineffective anyway. Writing methods currently being investigated in antiferromagnets are through spin-transfer torque and spin-orbit torque from the spin Hall effect and the Rashba effect. Reading information in antiferromagnets via magnetoresistance effects such as tunnel magnetoresistance is also being explored.[40]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]", "See also\n\n[edit]\n\nStuart S. P.

According to the European Commission, this possibly involves a molecular assembler based on biomolecular systems such as the ribosome.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Timeline of biotechnology\n\n1910: First identifiable use of the term synthetic biology in St\u00e9phane Leduc's publication Th\u00e9orie physico-chimique de la vie et g\u00e9n\u00e9rations spontan\u00e9es.[5] He also noted this term in another publication, La Biologie Synth\u00e9tique in 1912.[6]\n\n1944: Canadian-American scientist Oswald Avery shows that DNA is the material of which genes and chromosomes are made. This becomes the bedrock on which all subsequent genetic research is built.[7]\n\n1953: Francis Crick and James Watson publish the structure of the DNA in Nature.", "1953: Francis Crick and James Watson publish the structure of the DNA in Nature.\n\n1961: Jacob and Monod postulate cellular regulation by molecular networks from their study of the lac operon in E. coli and envisioned the ability to assemble new systems from molecular components.[8]\n\n1973: First molecular cloning and amplification of DNA in a plasmid is published in P.N.A.S. by Cohen, Boyer et al. constituting the dawn of synthetic biology.[9]\n\n1978: Arber, Nathans and Smith win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of restriction enzymes, leading Szybalski to offer an editorial comment in the journal Gene:\n\nThe work on restriction nucleases not only permits us easily to construct recombinant DNA molecules and to analyze individual genes, but also has led us into the new era of synthetic biology where not only existing genes are described and analyzed but also new gene arrangements can be constructed and evaluated.[10]", "1988: First DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a thermostable DNA polymerase is published in Science by Mullis et al.[11] This obviated adding new DNA polymerase after each PCR cycle, thus greatly simplifying DNA mutagenesis and assembly.\n\n2000: Two papers in Nature report synthetic biological circuits, a genetic toggle switch and a biological clock, by combining genes within E. coli cells.[12][13]\n\n2003: The most widely used standardized DNA parts, BioBrick plasmids, are invented by Tom Knight.[14] These parts will become central to the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition founded at MIT in the following year.\n\n2003: Researchers engineer an artemisinin precursor pathway in E. coli.[15]\n\n2004: First international conference for synthetic biology, Synthetic Biology 1.0 (SB1.0) is held at MIT.\n\n2005: Researchers develop a light-sensing circuit in E. coli.[16] Another group designs circuits capable of multicellular pattern formation.[17]", "2006: Researchers engineer a synthetic circuit that promotes bacterial invasion of tumour cells.[18]\n\n2010: Researchers publish in Science the first synthetic bacterial genome, called M. mycoides JCVI-syn1.0.[19][20] The genome is made from chemically-synthesized DNA using yeast recombination.\n\n2011: Functional synthetic chromosome arms are engineered in yeast.[21]\n\n2012: Charpentier and Doudna labs publish in Science the programming of CRISPR-Cas9 bacterial immunity for targeting DNA cleavage.[22] This technology greatly simplified and expanded eukaryotic gene editing.\n\n2019: Scientists at ETH Zurich report the creation of the first bacterial genome, named Caulobacter ethensis-2.0, made entirely by a computer, although a related viable form of C. ethensis-2.0 does not yet exist.[23][24]", "2019: Researchers report the production of a new synthetic (possibly artificial) form of viable life, a variant of the bacteria Escherichia coli, by reducing the natural number of 64 codons in the bacterial genome to 59 codons instead, in order to encode 20 amino acids.[25][26]\n\n2020: Scientists created the first xenobot, a programmable synthetic organism derived from frog cells and designed by AI.[27] Demis Hassabis and John M. Jumper presented an AI model called AlphaFold2. With its help, they have been able to predict the structure of virtually all the 200 million proteins that researchers have identified. Since their breakthrough, AlphaFold2 has been used by more than two million people from 190 countries. Among a myriad of scientific applications, researchers can now better understand antibiotic resistance and create images of enzymes that can decompose plastic.[28] [29]", "2021: Scientists reported that xenobots are able to self-replicate by gathering loose cells in the environment and then forming new xenobots.[30]\n\n2023: Advancements in RNA therapeutics, including vaccines, RNA circuits, and genetic modifications, have improved safety and efficiency in synthetic biology. RNA-based therapeutics are considered safer than DNA-based systems as they do not integrate into the host genome, reducing the risk of unintended genetic alterations. Additionally, RNA-based systems, constructed from RNA devices and circuits, act more rapidly than DNA-based counterparts since they do not require transcription. These advancements have expanded the potential applications of RNA in gene therapy, personalized medicine, and vaccine development.[31]\n\nPerspectives\n\n[edit]\n\nIt is a field whose scope is expanding in terms of systems integration, engineered organisms, and practical findings.[1]", "It is a field whose scope is expanding in terms of systems integration, engineered organisms, and practical findings.[1]\n\nEngineers view biology as technology (in other words, a given system includes biotechnology or its biological engineering).[32] Synthetic biology includes the broad redefinition and expansion of biotechnology, with the ultimate goal of being able to design and build engineered live biological systems that process information, manipulate chemicals, fabricate materials and structures, produce energy, provide food, and maintain and enhance human health, as well as advance fundamental knowledge of biological systems (see Biomedical engineering) and our environment.[33]\n\nResearchers and companies working in synthetic biology are using nature's power to solve issues in agriculture, manufacturing, and medicine.[3]", "Due to more powerful genetic engineering capabilities and decreased DNA synthesis and sequencing costs, the field of synthetic biology is rapidly growing. In 2016, more than 350 companies across 40 countries were actively engaged in synthetic biology applications; all these companies had an estimated net worth of $3.9 billion in the global market.[34] Synthetic biology currently has no generally accepted definition. Here are a few examples:\n\nIt is the science of emerging genetic and physical engineering to produce new (and, therefore, synthetic) life forms. To develop organisms with novel or enhanced characteristics, this emerging field of study combines biology, engineering, and related disciplines' knowledge and techniques to design chemically synthesised DNA.[35][36]", "Biomolecular engineering includes approaches that aim to create a toolkit of functional units that can be introduced to present new technological functions in living cells. Genetic engineering includes approaches to construct synthetic chromosomes or minimal organisms like Mycoplasma laboratorium.\n\nBiomolecular design refers to the general idea of de novo design and additive combination of biomolecular components. Each of these approaches shares a similar task: to develop a more synthetic entity at a higher level of complexity by inventively manipulating a simpler part at the preceding level.[37][38] Optimizing these exogenous pathways in unnatural systems takes iterative fine-tuning of the individual biomolecular components to select the highest concentrations of the desired product.[39]", "On the other hand, \"re-writers\" are synthetic biologists interested in testing the irreducibility of biological systems. Due to the complexity of natural biological systems, it would be simpler to rebuild the natural systems of interest from the ground up; to provide engineered surrogates that are easier to comprehend, control and manipulate.[40] Re-writers draw inspiration from refactoring, a process sometimes used to improve computer software.\n\nCategories\n\n[edit]\n\nBioengineering, synthetic genomics, protocell synthetic biology, unconventional molecular biology, and in silico techniques are the five categories of synthetic biology.[41]\n\nIt is necessary to review the distinctions and analogies between the categories of synthetic biology for its social and ethical assessment, to distinguish between issues affecting the whole field and particular to a specific one.[41]\n\nBioengineering\n\n[edit]", "Bioengineering\n\n[edit]\n\nThe subfield of bioengineering concentrates on creating novel metabolic and regulatory pathways, and is currently the one that likely draws the attention of most researchers and funding. It is primarily motivated by the desire to establish biotechnology as a legitimate engineering discipline. When referring to this area of synthetic biology, the word \"bioengineering\" should not be confused with \"traditional genetic engineering\", which involves introducing a single transgene into the intended organism. Bioengineers adapted synthetic biology to provide a substantially more integrated perspective on how to alter organisms or metabolic systems.[41]", "A typical example of single-gene genetic engineering is the insertion of the human insulin gene into bacteria to create transgenic proteins. The creation of whole new signalling pathways, containing numerous genes and regulatory components (such as an oscillator circuit to initiate the periodic production of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in mammalian cells), is known as bioengineering as part of synthetic biology.[41]\n\nBy utilising simplified and abstracted metabolic and regulatory modules as well as other standardized parts that may be freely combined to create new pathways or creatures, bioengineering aims to create innovative biological systems. In addition to creating infinite opportunities for novel applications, this strategy is anticipated to make bioengineering more predictable and controllable than traditional biotechnology.[41]\n\nSynthetic genomics\n\n[edit]", "Synthetic genomics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe formation of animals with a chemically manufactured (minimal) genome is another facet of synthetic biology that is highlighted by synthetic genomics. This area of synthetic biology has been made possible by ongoing advancements in DNA synthesis technology, which now makes it feasible to produce DNA molecules with thousands of base pairs at a reasonable cost. The goal is to combine these molecules into complete genomes and transplant them into living cells, replacing the host cell's genome and reprogramming its metabolism to perform different functions.[41]\n\nScientists have previously demonstrated the potential of this approach by creating infectious viruses by synthesising the genomes of multiple viruses. These significant advances in science and technology triggered the initial public concerns concerning the risks associated with this technology.[41]", "A simple genome might also work as a \"chassis genome\" that could be enlarged quickly by gene inclusion created for particular tasks. Such \"chassis creatures\" would be more suited for the insertion of new functions than wild organisms since they would have fewer biological pathways that could potentially conflict with the new functionalities in addition to having specific insertion sites. Synthetic genomics strives to create creatures with novel \"architectures,\" much like the bioengineering method. It adopts an integrative or holistic perspective of the organism. In this case, the objective is the creation of chassis genomes based on necessary genes and other required DNA sequences rather than the design of metabolic or regulatory pathways based on abstract criteria.[41]\n\nProtocell synthetic biology\n\n[edit]", "Protocell synthetic biology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe in vitro generation of synthetic cells is the protocell branch of synthetic biology. Lipid vesicles, which have all the necessary components to function as a complete system, can be used to create these artificial cells. In the end, these synthetic cells should meet the requirements for being deemed alive, namely the capacity for self-replication, self-maintenance, and evolution. The protocell technique has this as its end aim, however there are other intermediary steps that fall short of meeting all the criteria for a living cell. In order to carry out a specific function, these lipid vesicles contain cell extracts or more specific sets of biological macromolecules and complex structures, such as enzymes, nucleic acids, or ribosomes. For instance, liposomes may carry out particular polymerase chain reactions or synthesise a particular protein.[41]", "Protocell synthetic biology takes artificial life one step closer to reality by eventually synthesizing not only the genome but also every component of the cell in vitro, as opposed to the synthetic genomics approach, which relies on coercing a natural cell to carry out the instructions encoded by the introduced synthetic genome. Synthetic biologists in this field view their work as basic study into the conditions necessary for life to exist and its origin more than in any of the other techniques. The protocell technique, however, also lends itself well to applications; similar to other synthetic biology byproducts, protocells could be employed for the manufacture of biopolymers and medicines.[41]\n\nUnconventional molecular biology\n\n[edit]", "Unconventional molecular biology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe objective of the \"unnatural molecular biology\" strategy is to create new varieties of life that are based on a different kind of molecular biology, such as new types of nucleic acids or a new genetic code. The creation of new types of nucleotides that can be built into unique nucleic acids could be accomplished by changing certain DNA or RNA constituents, such as the bases or the backbone sugars.[41]\n\nThe normal genetic code is being altered by inserting quadruplet codons or changing some codons to encode new amino acids, which would subsequently permit the use of non-natural amino acids with unique features in protein production. It is a scientific and technological problem to adjust the enzymatic machinery of the cell for both approaches.[41]", "A new sort of life would be formed by organisms with a genome built on synthetic nucleic acids or on a totally new coding system for synthetic amino acids. This new style of life would have some benefits but also some new dangers. On release into the environment, there would be no horizontal gene transfer or outcrossing of genes with natural species. Furthermore, these kinds of synthetic organisms might be created to require non-natural materials for protein or nucleic acid synthesis, rendering them unable to thrive in the wild if they accidentally escaped.[41]\n\nOn the other hand, if these organisms ultimately were able to survive outside of controlled space, they might have a particular benefit over natural organisms because they would be resistant to predatory living organisms or natural viruses, that could lead to an unmanaged spread of the synthetic organisms.[41]\n\nIn silico technique\n\n[edit]", "In silico technique\n\n[edit]\n\nSynthetic biology in silico and the various strategies are interconnected. The development of complex designs, whether they are metabolic pathways, fundamental cellular processes, or chassis genomes, is one of the major difficulties faced by the four synthetic-biology methods outlined above. Because of this, synthetic biology has a robust in silico branch, similar to systems biology, that aims to create computational models for the design of common biological components or synthetic circuits, which are essentially simulations of synthetic organisms.[41]\n\nThe practical application of simulations and models through bioengineering or other fields of synthetic biology is the long-term goal of in silico synthetic biology. Many of the computational simulations of synthetic organisms up to this point possess little to no direct analogy to living things. Due to this, in silico synthetic biology is regarded as a separate group in this article.[41]", "It is sensible to integrate the five areas under the umbrella of synthetic biology as one unified area of study. Even though they focus on various facets of life, such as metabolic regulation, essential elements, or biochemical makeup, these five strategies all work toward the same end: creating new types of living organisms. Additionally, the varied methodologies begin with numerous methodological approaches, which leads to the diversity of synthetic biology approaches.[41]", "Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that draws from and is inspired by many different scientific disciplines, not one single field or technique. Synthetic biologists all have the same underlying objective of designing and producing new forms of life, despite the fact that they may employ various methodologies, techniques, and research instruments. Any evaluation of synthetic biology, whether it examines ethical, legal, or safety considerations, must take into account the fact that while some questions, risks, and issues are unique to each technique, in other circumstances, synthetic biology as a whole must be taken into consideration.[41]\n\nFour engineering approaches\n\n[edit]\n\nSynthetic biology has traditionally been divided into four different engineering approaches: top down, parallel, orthogonal and bottom up.[42]", "To replicate emergent behaviours from natural biology and build artificial life, unnatural chemicals are used. The other looks for interchangeable components from biological systems to put together and create systems that do not work naturally. In either case, a synthetic objective compels researchers to venture into new area in order to engage and resolve issues that cannot be readily resolved by analysis. Due to this, new paradigms are driven to arise in ways that analysis cannot easily do. In addition to equipments that oscillate, creep, and play tic-tac-toe, synthetic biology has produced diagnostic instruments that enhance the treatment of patients with infectious diseases.[43]\n\nTop-down approach\n\n[edit]", "Top-down approach\n\n[edit]\n\nIt involves using metabolic and genetic engineering techniques to impart new functions to living cells.[44] By comparing universal genes and eliminating non-essential ones to create a basic genome, this method seeks to lessen the complexity of existing cells. These initiatives are founded on the hypothesis of a single genesis for cellular life, the so-called Last Universal Common Ancestor, which supports the presence of a universal minimal genome that gave rise to all living things. Recent studies, however, raise the possibility that the eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells that make up the tree of life may have evolved from a group of primordial cells rather than from a single cell. As a result, even while the Holy Grail-like pursuit of the \"minimum genome\" has grown elusive, cutting out a number of non-essential functions impairs an organism's fitness and leads to \"fragile\" genomes.[42]\n\nBottom-up approach\n\n[edit]", "Bottom-up approach\n\n[edit]\n\nThis approach involves creating new biological systems in vitro by bringing together 'non-living' biomolecular components,[45] often with the aim of constructing an artificial cell.\n\nReproduction, replication, and assembly are three crucial self-organizational principles that are taken into account in order to accomplish this. Cells, which are made up of a container and a metabolism, are considered \"hardware\" in the definition of reproduction, whereas replication occurs when a system duplicates a perfect copy of itself, as in the case of DNA, which is considered \"software.\" When vesicles or containers (such as Oparin's coacervates) formed of tiny", "Topological quantum computer\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\n\nCatal\u00e0\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\n\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc\n\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n\nTi\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t\n\nEdit links\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nType of quantum computer", "\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n\nTi\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t\n\nEdit links\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nType of quantum computer\n\nA topological quantum computer is a type of quantum computer. It utilizes anyons, a type of quasiparticle that occurs in two-dimensional systems. The anyons' world lines intertwine to form braids in a three-dimensional spacetime (one temporal and two spatial dimensions). The braids act as the logic gates of the computer. The primary advantage of using quantum braids over trapped quantum particles is in their stability. While small but cumulative perturbations can cause quantum states to decohere and introduce errors in traditional quantum computations, such perturbations do not alter the topological properties of the braids. This stability is akin to the difference between cutting and reattaching a string to form a different braid versus a ball (representing an ordinary quantum particle in four-dimensional spacetime) colliding with a wall. It was proposed by Russian-American physicist Alexei Kitaev in 1997.[2]", "While the elements of a topological quantum computer originate in a purely mathematical realm, experiments in fractional quantum Hall systems indicate that these elements may be created in the real world by using semiconductors made of gallium arsenide at a temperature of nearly absolute zero and subject to strong magnetic fields.\n\nIntroduction\n\n[edit]\n\nAnyons are quasiparticles in a two-dimensional space. Anyons are neither fermions nor bosons, but like fermions, they cannot occupy the same state. Thus, the world lines of two anyons cannot intersect or merge, which allows their paths to form stable braids in space-time. Anyons can form from excitations in a cold two-dimensional electron gas in a very strong magnetic field and carry fractional units of magnetic flux. This phenomenon is called the fractional quantum Hall effect. In typical laboratory systems, the electron gas occupies a thin semiconducting layer sandwiched between layers of aluminum gallium arsenide.[3][4]", "When anyons are braided, the transformation of the quantum state of the system depends only on the topological class of the anyons' trajectories (which are classified according to the braid group). Therefore, the quantum information which is stored in the state of the system is impervious to small errors in the trajectories.[5] In 2005, Sankar Das Sarma, Michael Freedman, and Chetan Nayak proposed a quantum Hall device that would realize a topological qubit. In 2005 Vladimir J. Goldman, Fernando E. Camino, and Wei Zhou[6] claimed to have created and observed the first experimental evidence for using a fractional quantum Hall effect to create actual anyons, although others have suggested their results could be the product of phenomena not involving anyons. Non-abelian anyons, a species required for topological quantum computers, have yet to be experimentally confirmed. Possible experimental evidence has been found,[7] but the conclusions remain contested.[8] In 2018, scientists again claimed to have isolated", "evidence has been found,[7] but the conclusions remain contested.[8] In 2018, scientists again claimed to have isolated the required Majorana particles, but the finding was retracted in 2021. Quanta Magazine stated in 2021 that \"no one has convincingly shown the existence of even a single (Majorana zero-mode) quasiparticle\",[9] although in 2023 a new article[10] by the magazine has covered some preprints by Google[11] and Quantinuum[12] claiming the realization of non-abelian anyons on quantum processors, the first used a toric code with twist defects as a topological degeneracy (or topological defect) while the second used a different but related protocol both of which can be understood as Majorana bound states in quantum error correction.", "Topological vs. standard quantum computer\n\n[edit]\n\nTopological quantum computers are equivalent in computational power to other standard models of quantum computation, in particular to the quantum circuit model and to the quantum Turing machine model.[13] That is, any of these models can efficiently simulate any of the others. Nonetheless, certain algorithms may be a more natural fit to the topological quantum computer model. For example, algorithms for evaluating the Jones polynomial were first developed in the topological model, and only later converted and extended in the standard quantum circuit model.\n\nComputations\n\n[edit]", "Computations\n\n[edit]\n\nTo live up to its name, a topological quantum computer must provide the unique computation properties promised by a conventional quantum computer design, which uses trapped quantum particles. In 2000, Michael H. Freedman, Alexei Kitaev, Michael J. Larsen, and Zhenghan Wang proved that a topological quantum computer can, in principle, perform any computation that a conventional quantum computer can do, and vice versa.[13][14][15]", "They found that a conventional quantum computer device, given an error-free operation of its logic circuits, will give a solution with an absolute level of accuracy, whereas a topological quantum computing device with flawless operation will give the solution with only a finite level of accuracy. However, any level of precision for the answer can be obtained by adding more braid twists (logic circuits) to the topological quantum computer, in a simple linear relationship. In other words, a reasonable increase in elements (braid twists) can achieve a high degree of accuracy in the answer. Actual computation [gates] are done by the edge states of a fractional quantum Hall effect. This makes models of one-dimensional anyons important. In one space dimension, anyons are defined algebraically.\n\nError correction and control\n\n[edit]", "Error correction and control\n\n[edit]\n\nEven though quantum braids are inherently more stable than trapped quantum particles, there is still a need to control for error inducing thermal fluctuations, which produce random stray pairs of anyons which interfere with adjoining braids. Controlling these errors is simply a matter of separating the anyons to a distance where the rate of interfering strays drops to near zero. Simulating the dynamics of a topological quantum computer may be a promising method of implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation even with a standard quantum information processing scheme. Raussendorf, Harrington, and Goyal have studied one model, with promising simulation results.[16]\n\nExample: Computing with Fibonacci anyons\n\n[edit]", "Example: Computing with Fibonacci anyons\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the prominent examples in topological quantum computing is with a system of Fibonacci anyons. A Fibonacci anyon has been described as \"an emergent particle with the property that as you add more particles to the system, the number of quantum states grows like the Fibonacci sequence, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.\"[17] In the context of conformal field theory, fibonacci anyons are described by the Yang\u2013Lee model, the SU(2) special case of the Chern\u2013Simons theory and Wess\u2013Zumino\u2013Witten models.[18] These anyons can be used to create generic gates for topological quantum computing. There are three main steps for creating a model:\n\nChoose our basis and restrict our Hilbert space\n\nBraid the anyons together\n\nFuse the anyons at the end and detect how they fuse in order to read the output of the system.\n\nState preparation\n\n[edit]\n\nFibonacci anyons are defined by three qualities:\n\nThey have a topological charge of\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tau }", "[edit]\n\nFibonacci anyons are defined by three qualities:\n\nThey have a topological charge of\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tau }\n\n. In this discussion, we consider another charge called\n\n{\\displaystyle 1}\n\nwhich is the \u2018vacuum\u2019 charge if anyons are annihilated with each-other.\n\nEach of these anyons are their own antiparticle.\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tau =\\tau ^{*}}\n\nand\n\n{\\displaystyle 1=1^{*}}\n\n.\n\nIf brought close to each other, they will 'fuse' together in a nontrivial fashion. Specifically, the 'fusion' rules are:\n\n{\\displaystyle 1\\otimes 1=1}\n\n{\\displaystyle 1\\otimes \\tau =\\tau \\otimes 1=\\tau }\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tau \\otimes \\tau =1\\oplus \\tau }\n\nMany of the properties of this system can be explained similarly to that of two spin 1/2 particles. Particularly, we use the same tensor product\n\n{\\displaystyle \\otimes }\n\nand direct sum\n\n{\\displaystyle \\oplus }\n\noperators.\n\nThe last \u2018fusion\u2019 rule can be extended this to a system of three anyons:\n\nThus, fusing three anyons will yield a final state of total charge", "Thus, fusing three anyons will yield a final state of total charge\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tau }\n\nin 2 ways, or a charge of\n\n{\\displaystyle 1}\n\nin exactly one way. We use three states to define our basis.[19] However, because we wish to encode these three anyon states as superpositions of 0 and 1, we need to limit the basis to a two-dimensional Hilbert space. Thus, we consider only two states with a total charge of\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tau }\n\n. This choice is purely phenomenological. In these states, we group the two leftmost anyons into a 'control group', and leave the rightmost as a 'non-computational anyon'. We classify a\n\n{\\displaystyle |0\\rangle }\n\nstate as one where the control group has total 'fused' charge of\n\n{\\displaystyle 1}\n\n, and a state of\n\n{\\displaystyle |1\\rangle }\n\nhas a control group with a total 'fused' charge of\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tau }\n\n. For a more complete description, see Nayak.[19]\n\nGates\n\n[edit]", "{\\displaystyle \\tau }\n\n. For a more complete description, see Nayak.[19]\n\nGates\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the ideas above, adiabatically braiding these anyons around each-other will result in a unitary transformation. These braid operators are a result of two subclasses of operators:\n\nThe F matrix\n\nThe R matrix\n\nThe R matrix can be conceptually thought of as the topological phase that is imparted onto the anyons during the braid. As the anyons wind around each-other, they pick up some phase due to the Aharonov\u2013Bohm effect.", "The F matrix is a result of the physical rotations of the anyons. As they braid between each-other, it is important to realize that the bottom two anyons\u2014the control group\u2014will still distinguish the state of the qubit. Thus, braiding the anyons will change which anyons are in the control group, and therefore change the basis. We evaluate the anyons by always fusing the control group (the bottom anyons) together first, so exchanging which anyons these are will rotate the system. Because these anyons are non-abelian, the order of the anyons (which ones are within the control group) will matter, and as such they will transform the system.\n\nThe complete braid operator can be derived as:", "The complete braid operator can be derived as:\n\nIn order to mathematically construct the F and R operators, we can consider permutations of these F and R operators. We know that if we sequentially change the basis that we are operating on, this will eventually lead us back to the same basis. Similarly, we know that if we braid anyons around each-other a certain number of times, this will lead back to the same state. These axioms are called the pentagonal and hexagonal axioms respectively as performing the operation can be visualized with a pentagon/hexagon of state transformations. Although mathematically difficult,[20] these can be approached much more successfully visually.\n\nWith these braid operators, we can finally formalize the notion of braids in terms of how they act on our Hilbert space and construct arbitrary universal quantum gates.[21]\n\nExperimental efforts\n\n[edit]", "Experimental efforts\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2018, Leo Kouwenhoven working for Microsoft published a paper in Nature indicating to have found firm evidence of \"zero-bias peaks\" indicating Majorana quasiparticles. In 2020, the paper got an editorial note of concern. In 2021, in a follow-up paper it was indicated that the data in the 2018 paper was incomplete and misrepresented the results.[22]", "In 2023, Microsoft Quantum researchers published a paper in Physical Review that described a new device that can represent a logical qubit with hardware stability, measuring a phase of matter consistent with the observation of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes.[23] The scientists reported that \"such devices have demonstrated low enough disorder to pass the topological gap protocol, proving the technology is viable\".[24] This publication has been criticized by other scientists for not providing sufficient evidence for Majorana modes as in previous papers.[25] In a 2025 paper, Microsoft determined fermion parity in Majorana zero modes in a single shot, claiming to develop the first topological chip using a new state of matter called topoconductors.[26][27][28]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nTopological order\n\nSymmetry-protected topological order\n\nGinzburg\u2013Landau theory\n\nHusimi Q representation\n\nRandom matrix\n\nMajorana 1\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]", "Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory\n\nHusimi Q representation\n\nRandom matrix\n\nMajorana 1\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\n^ Hormozi, L.; Zikos, G.; Bonesteel, N.E.; Simon, S.H.
